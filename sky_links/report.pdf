Graph Structure
The problem domain was represented using a graph data structure:
    Nodes: Cities (e.g., Prague, Berlin, Paris, Vienna, London)
    Edges: Air routes between Cities
The graph was implemented using an adjacency list representation, because it identifies alternative path between cities.

Algorithms Used
The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm was used because of its ability to explore all possible paths from a starting city to a destination city.

Evaluation
The DFS approach successfully identified redundant routes like London -> Paris and Paris -> Vienna.
What was learned beyond the discussed issues: how graph algorithms can be applied to real-world problems like route optimization in transportation networks.
